# Nimiq Frankenstein

A collection of Vue 3 components built for different projects, but designed to be as reusable as possible.

<div class="i-nimiq:fire" />

This is not a library which you download and start using it. Instead, you will need to copy and paste it and use the components in your projects, leaving you the option of adapting the component to your needs.

Connecting the dots, you can now understand why is called `Frankenstein`, multiple pieces that you can put together to build you app!

## Requirements

Each component is different and has slightly different requirements, but in general, you will need to depend on the shoulders of giants:

### Vue 3.15+

This library is meant to be used with Vue 3.15+, if you need a lower version, you might need to adapt the code.

### Reka UI

An awesome headless UI library which allows you to build your own components but with a huge amount of well-known functionality like a modal or combobox. You can find more information on their [website](https://reka-ui.com).

### VueUse

A collection of useful Vue composition functions. You can find more information on their [website](https://vueuse.org).

### Nimiq CSS

A UnoCSS preset that I've built for the Nimiq ecosystem. You can find more information on the [Nimiq CSS](/nimiq-css) page.
