# Grids

Think of grids as the Marie Kondo of UI components - they help keep your cards organized and spark joy in your layouts!

> [!TIP]
> Remember to [register `NqGrid`](/vitepress-theme/#register-the-components) in your app. It's like organizing a party - you need to tell the bouncer who's allowed in!

## Basic grid

<NqCard>

#### The Three Musketeers: Part 1

All for one and one for all! I'm just the first musketeer in this grid adventure.

Second musketeer reporting for duty! I keep the middle space warm and cozy.

## Complex Grid

<ComponentPreview>

<NqGrid>

<NqCard bg-color="blue" href="#" icon="i-nimiq:icons-lg-browsermesh">

#### Build Something Cool {.nq-label}

##### Your Journey Starts Here

Like building with LEGO, but for grown-ups who code!

</NqCard>

<NqCard bg-color="green" href="#" icon="i-nimiq:icons-lg-cubes">

#### Learn The Ropes {.nq-label}

##### Beyond "Hello World"

Because understanding Nimiq is easier than explaining why you need another mechanical keyboard.

</NqCard>

<NqCard>

#### The Support Squad

We're like your coding best friends, minus the coffee borrowing.

</NqCard>

<NqCard>

#### The Innovation Corner

Where ideas come to party and bugs come to retire.

</NqCard>

<NqCard>

#### The Fun Zone

Because who said documentation had to be boring?

## Grid with Large Cards

<NqGrid>

<NqLargeCard icon="i-nimiq:tools">

#### The Wise Elder

I'm the big card that's seen it all. Think of me as the senior developer of cards.

</NqLargeCard>

<NqLargeCard icon="i-nimiq:tools">

#### The Middle Manager

I keep things balanced, like a good project manager (but more reliable).

</NqLargeCard>

<NqLargeCard icon="i-nimiq:tools">

#### The Team Player

I complete the trio with style. Three's company, four's a grid overflow!
