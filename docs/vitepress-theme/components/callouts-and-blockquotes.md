## GitHub Callouts

Same as [GitHub Markdown Callouts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts), you can use them in your projects:

<ComponentPreview>

> [!NOTE]
> Did you hear about the programmer who got stuck in the shower? They were following the instructions on the shampoo bottle: Lather, Rinse, Repeat.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to take breaks from coding. Your keyboard needs time to forget all those angry keystrokes from debugging.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Coffee intake should be proportional to lines of code written. It's just science.

> [!WARNING]
> Side effects may include: talking in JSON, dreaming in code, and accidentally saying "sudo please" to your cat.

> [!CAUTION]
> Excessive use of console.log() may lead to deforestation of your terminal screen.

</ComponentPreview>

You can also add custom title to the callouts:

> [!NOTE] Developer's Life Lesson #42
> Remember: There are only 10 types of people in the world - those who understand binary and those who don't.
